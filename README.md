# Iframe Widgets 

A simple example for using the window.postMessage api, jQuery, and iframes to register a set of widgets, validation (loosely based on spotify widget model where bundle and manifest are declared), and callback support within api

# Running the example

	1. Make sure to install all dependencies


		``` bower install ```
		``` npm install ```
		``` npm install -g gulp ```

	2. Run the gulp step (default), this will handle automatically setting up the correct script paths within a connect webserver and navigate you directly to the appropriate webpage

		``` gulp ```
